- Widgetizing items in both Home and Search screen
- Moving to Backend driven UI
- Using Protobuf for network response instead of JSON
- Integrated DB layer for caching Homepage response with TTL
- Worked on M\*N (M cross N widget) which is used extensively on both the homepage and search. We are planning to use it across the app.
